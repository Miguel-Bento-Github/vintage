## Tax Treatment by Jurisdiction

### United States

**General Rule:** Most states exempt used goods from sales tax when sold by individuals or certain small businesses.

**Key Points:**
- **Individual Sales:** If you're selling personal items (not running a business), most states do not require sales tax collection
- **Business Sales:** If you're operating as a business, sales tax rules vary by state
- **Exemption Rationale:** Tax was already paid when the item was originally purchased new
- **State Variations:** Some states have specific thresholds or rules for second-hand dealers

**Recommended Actions:**
- Determine if your sales constitute a business in your state
- Check your state's specific rules for second-hand goods
- Consider obtaining a sales tax permit if required
- Maintain records showing items are genuinely second-hand

### European Union

**General Rule:** Second-hand goods sold under the VAT Margin Scheme are exempt from standard VAT.

**Margin Scheme Details:**
- VAT is only charged on the profit margin (difference between purchase and sale price)
- Standard VAT rate is NOT applied to the full sale price
- Applies to second-hand goods, works of art, collectors' items, and antiques
- Requires specific record-keeping of purchase and sale prices

**Eligibility:**
- Goods must have been previously used
- Purchased from non-VAT registered persons or under the margin scheme
- Cannot reclaim VAT on purchases under this scheme

**Recommended Actions:**
- Register for the VAT Margin Scheme if eligible
- Keep detailed records of acquisition costs
- Issue proper invoices that clearly state "Margin scheme - second-hand goods"
- Consult with a VAT specialist for cross-border sales

### United Kingdom

**General Rule:** Second-hand goods sold under the VAT Margin Scheme are exempt from standard VAT.

**Post-Brexit Considerations:**
- VAT Margin Scheme still applies as it did under EU rules
- No VAT on exports to non-UK buyers (with proper documentation)
- Different rules may apply for goods valued over £6,000
- Northern Ireland may have special rules due to Protocol

**Recommended Actions:**
- Use the VAT Margin Scheme for second-hand goods
- Understand export documentation requirements
- Keep records of item provenance and purchase prices
- Review HMRC guidance regularly for post-Brexit updates

### Canada

**General Rule:** GST/HST generally does not apply when individuals sell their used personal property.

**Key Points:**
- **Personal Property:** No GST/HST required if selling personal items
- **Business Threshold:** If annual sales exceed CAD $30,000, you must register for GST/HST
- **Input Tax Credits:** Cannot claim ITCs on second-hand purchases from individuals
- **Provincial Variations:** Some provinces have additional sales taxes (PST, QST)

**Recommended Actions:**
- Track annual sales to monitor threshold
- Register for GST/HST if you exceed $30,000 in revenue
- Keep records proving items are personal property
- Check provincial tax requirements

### Australia

**General Rule:** GST may not apply to second-hand goods sold by individuals.

**Key Points:**
- **Registered for GST:** If your business turnover exceeds AUD $75,000, you must register
- **Margin Scheme:** Available for second-hand goods to calculate GST on profit margin only
- **Personal Sales:** Individuals selling personal items generally don't charge GST
- **Record-Keeping:** Must maintain proper documentation

**Recommended Actions:**
- Determine if you meet GST registration threshold
- Use the GST margin scheme if eligible
- Issue proper tax invoices if registered
- Consult with a tax professional for clarification

### Japan

**General Rule:** Consumption tax rules for used goods differ from new goods.

**Key Points:**
- **Business Threshold:** Businesses with annual sales under ¥10 million may be exempt
- **Used Goods Margin:** Special calculation method for second-hand items
- **Documentation:** Must maintain records proving second-hand status
- **Individual Sales:** Private individuals generally don't charge consumption tax

**Recommended Actions:**
- Determine if you meet business registration requirements
- Use appropriate calculation method for second-hand goods
- Maintain purchase and sale records
- Consider consulting with a zeirishi (tax accountant)
